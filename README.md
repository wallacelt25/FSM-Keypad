# FSM-Final Project (Keypad System)

I am Wallace from L1BC here to show my FSM Final Project

The real example of a system that I took was:
**Keypad system** 

**How it works following with it's states**

FSM states:  
* States: 
Idle: this is the initial state when the system is waiting for a key press
Key press: this is the state that indicates that a key has been pressed
Key release: this is the state that indicates that the key has been released
